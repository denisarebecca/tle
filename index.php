<p align = "left"><Font size = "5"><Font color = "black"> 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
<br>is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
<br>Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and  
<br>recover without special treatment. In early 2020, following an outbreak in China in 
<br>December 2019, the World Health Organization described SARS-CoV-2 as a new form of coronavirus.
<br>The epidemic spread rapidly across the world. COVID-19 is a
SARS-CoV-2disease that can cause what doctors call respiratory tract infection.
<br>It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). 
<br>It spreads in the same way as other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. 
Infections range from mild to fatal.

<br>Our drawing is all about the star, jesus Christ and the dove. These three things that we have drawn are all we need when it 
<br>comes to survivng these days. The dove signifies hope itself throughthe form of the holy spirit. While the star serves as
<br>the light for the three kings. The light that can let them find their way to the son of God and the savior Jesus Christ.
<br>Jesus there is the one guiding us all throughout these hard times. Now that we encounter a lot of challenges in life, we hold on to prayer.
<br>A prayer that can be beneficial to ourselves or to everyone else. The three things mentioned above are hope itself. We pray to them that they 
should guid us  and let us overcome these obstacle in life.

 <p id="about">ABOUT US</p>
</H3>
We named ourselves the Birds of Hope because we want to give people hope by giving them information about COVID19, 
<br>we want to make sure that they shouldn't worry because COVID19 isn't invincible. 
<br>We don't want to turn everyone down so we provide information like these to make them feel at ease, 
<br>and to think for themselves that they should get ready since they now know how to avoid COVID19 and what are the symptoms and 
<br>the like. Our team wants you to rely on us if it's about information, and we also want you to know that we are your symbols of Hope.
<br>
Our group consists of five people, Jeremiah Notarte also known as Sparrow, Jude Calderon also known as Depleted Pigeon. 
<br>Rebecca Denisa also known as Monsieur Chikin Wing, and John Danielle Giducos who is also known as Koreanabulalo. 
<br>Lastly, Cassandra Tiangson, no contribution.
